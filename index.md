# Introduction to C++

## Science and Engineering Extracurricular Award Scheme 2018

Welcome to the Github page for the *Introduction to C++* short course which
forms part of the 2018 summer term Extracurricular Award Scheme in the Faculty of Science
and Engineering at Manchester Metropolitan University. The aim of the course is
to provide an introduction and taster of programming in the C++ language.
C++ is a __huge__ language, and even seasoned C++ programmers usually use subsets of it
but we will cover enough to get you started. We will also use the SFML graphics library, so
the course will have a games programming flavour.

The course runs over three weeks. In each week there will be an hour of __tutorial/demo__
followed by two hours of __practical work__. In the practical sessions you will be __pair programming__
to solve problems and write code using the language features covered that week. 

[Week 1 Notes](week1notes.md) In week 1, we cover the basics of the language: types, variables, loops, conditionals, functions, console I/O and C++ strings. In week 1, we will essentially be writing in __C__ (but using C++ style strings and I/O), and making simple console applications. 

[Week 1 Practical](week1practical.md) Week 1's practical session is about familiarization with Visual Studio, and writing some simple console
applications. The main project will be writing a program that uses an interesting technique to calculate the value of __pi__. We will use the whole
classroom as a sort of parallel supercomputer (albeit with some communication using pencil and paper) and see how accurate we can get.


[Week 2 Notes](week2notes.md) In week 2, we introduce object-oriented progrmming in C++. We also introduce the use of the __SFML__ graphics library so we can move away from text-based applications and animate some sprites.

[Week 2 Practical](week2practical.md) This week's practical session is a step-by-step tutorial in using SFML to implement a simple top-down animated character with walking animation. This could be a starting point for an RPG (role playing game) -- next week we will add some things for the character to do.

[Week 3 Notes](week3notes.md) In week 3, we look at references, STL (the standard template library), and inheritance in C++. 

[Week 3 Practical](week3practical.md) In the practical session, we will develop last week's SFML code into the beginnings of a game by adding some interactions with the world.
