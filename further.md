# Further reading

The 'bible' - written by __Bjarne Stroustrup__, the creator of C++ - is __"The C++ Programming Language"__. This is a big, expensive, heavy book. Buy this if you are really serious about C++ and will be writing a lot of it.

Lynda.com videos: There are some great C++ courses on Lynda, which you get a free subscription to with your MMU ID. Try these two:

__Learning C++__ (Peggy Fisher). This is a short (~2.5 hrs) introduction.

__C++ Essential Training__ (Bill Weinmann). This nearly 8-hour long course is a great overview of the language.

[cprogramming.com](http://www.cprogramming.com) is a good website with good quality tutorials and resources about the language.
